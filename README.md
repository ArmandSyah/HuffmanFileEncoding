# HuffmanFileEncoding

Taking Huffman Coding Assingment from Data Structures and Algorithms class and extending it to perform basic File Manipulation.

Language: Java, IDE: Eclipse

Description: As one of our projects for Data Structures, we were to design an algorithm that creates Huffman Trees from letters and their frequencies and using that tree to encode and decode various strings. Now, I'm extending this program to perform basic text file compression and text file decompression. Utilizes a Huffman Tree to encode letters into a set of bits that represent that letter.
